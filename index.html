    <p class="my-4">
      hey there! i'm aditya, 21, from india. i'm the guy who sees magic in every line of code and beauty in every pixel.
    </p>
    <p class="my-4">
      let's get this out of the way - i used to be a total nerd in school. now i'm just… a different kind of nerd. these days, i spend a fair bit of time tinkering with code and dreaming up cool project ideas. but don't worry, i won't bore you with tech talk.
    </p>
    <p class="my-4">fun fact: i used to play piano, but now my fingers dance on the keyboard for coding. i love reading books—though let's be honest, buying books is the real excitement.</p>
    <p class="my-4">
      when i'm not buried in a book or lost in the digital world, i'm probably scribbling down poems in my phone's notes app. they're not exactly franz kafka, but they keep me sane. i love rock music, but soft indie hits the spot too. and yes, my favorite anime is one piece, i just wanna sail the grand line with luffy and the gang.
    </p>
    <p class="my-4">luffy's my inspiration</p>
    <p class="my-4">
      i also fancy myself a bit of a philosopher. so if you're up for some deep, potentially nonsensical conversations about life, the universe, and everything, i'm your guy. (my discord: @psfr)!
    </p>
    <p class="my-4">i enjoy sunrises and all the simple joys that come with them.</p>
    <p class="my-4">
      anyway, that's me. stick around, maybe we'll cook up something cool together. or at the very least, we can debate whether buying books counts as a hobby. (spoiler alert: i think it does.)
    </p>
    
    <p class="my-4">that's all for now - stay awesome, folks!</p>
